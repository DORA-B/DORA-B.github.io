# Download and try these two demo 

Follow the steps described in [https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux_sources.html]

There are 2 types of demos, they are respectively colcon installation and ROS2-Fearures Compilation installation.

I downloaded both two.

But actually only Type2 is required.

use different types in command
```cmd

source ~/Desktop/ShapeDemo/install/setup.bash

source ~/Desktop/ShapeDemo_ros/install/setup.bash

```
***start demo in command***

> $ ShapesDemo

This is the base type of the file folder.
